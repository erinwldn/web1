  <h2>Vintage</h2>
  <p><strong><u>Vintage</u></strong>, The word vintage was first used in the early 15th century. It was taken from the <a href="https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl" target="_blank" title="Google">Old French vendage</a>, meaning wine harvest. This word was taken from the Latin vinum (wine) and demere (to remove).</p>
  <p style="margin-top:20px;">Vintage, in winemaking, is the process of picking grapes and creating the finished product (see Harvest (wine)). A vintage wine is one made from grapes that were all, or primarily, grown and harvested in a single specified year. In certain wines, it can denote quality, as in Port wine, where Port houses make and declare vintage Port in their best years. From this tradition, a common, though incorrect, usage applies the term to any wine that is perceived to be particularly old or of a particularly high quality.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:20px;">Most countries allow a vintage wine to include a portion of wine that is not from the year denoted on the label. In Chile and South Africa, the requirement is 75% same-year content for vintage-dated wine. In Australia, New Zealand, and the member states of the European Union, the requirement is 85%.</p>
